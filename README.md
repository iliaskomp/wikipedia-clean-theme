# Clean theme for Wikipedia

Clean wikipedia theme with the option of toggling on and off the top and left menus of wikipedia which sometimes I perceive to be noise. 

## How to use
In order to use the theme, the user needs to have a wikipedia theme. 

After logging in, go to Preferences > Appearance > Skin > Vector.

Click on "Custom CSS", then "Edit" at the top menu and copy paste the content of vector.css of this repo.
The same process goes for the vector.js file.
